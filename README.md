# Community-Detection

Hybrid Algorithm for Community Detection
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of two hybrid algorithms for community detection using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The paper detailing the research and methodology is titled "Mammal Hunting Algorithm and PW3: Hybrid Algorithm for Community Detection using PSO, GWO, and WOA".
Total 5 existing algorithms were analysied before making the hybrid. Genetic Evolution, Differential Evolution, Partile Swamp Optimization, Whale Optimization Approach, Gray Wolf Optimizarion, all were compared.

Folders
'1. Final Run Codes'
Contains all the codes which were executed to get the results.
'2. Raw Files while analysing(Helped in reaching final run codes)'
Conatins all the other codes and files(unfiltered) which were made during the whole process, you can ignore this section.
'Datasets'
Contains all 8 datasets used for the comparison between the algorithms.
'Final Results'
Conatins the obtained results.

Requirements
Python

Usage
Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
Open new Folder and get code from '1. Final Run Codes' and files from 'Datasets'.
Start running each python file to get results accourdingly to datasets.
You can analyze and compare the results using statistical analysis tools of your choice.

Results
The results of the experiment are stored in the results folder. The .xlsx files contain the performance evaluation metrics of the algorithms on the test graphs. The evaluation measures include:
Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
Modularity
Community Score
Error of Community Score
